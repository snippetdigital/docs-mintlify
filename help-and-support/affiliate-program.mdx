Help others discover the power of Keyword Insights and get rewarded for it. When you refer someone to Keyword Insights using your unique referral link, you’ll earn 20% commission on every sale they make, for life.

This is more than a one-time payout. It’s a true passive income stream: every time someone you refer upgrades or renews, you get paid. No limits, no expiration.

Whether you’re recommending it to colleagues, clients, or your online audience, it’s a win-win. They get access to one of the most powerful topical authority platforms on the market and you get paid every step of the way.
