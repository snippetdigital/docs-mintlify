3. The number of available keywords from your search.
4. Keyword 
5. Search volume
6. Advanced filters - Using these filters, you can narrow down your keywords. You can apply things like brand vs non-brand, topical relevancy and many other suggestions Google provides.
7. After you have cleaned up your list, click this button to download your CSV file.

Note: Keyword Insights requires you to upload a file with the keyword and search volume columns, and you can map these columns easily. It means you don't have to tweak the downloaded CSV file, and It's ready for keyword insights.

Now go ahead and upload the file to Keyword insights. :thumbsup:

### Start with a website.

Put your URL prefix or root domain into the search box.

In this example, I added a URL prefix instead of a domain and selected the 'Use only this page' option. I want to find out all the keywords this URL is ranking for. 

The results are displayed as follows. You can apply filters and download the CSV file.
