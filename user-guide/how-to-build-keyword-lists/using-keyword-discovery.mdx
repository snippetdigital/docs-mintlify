### How do you use Keyword Discovery?

Keyword Discovery lets you quickly input a seed keyword and generate hundreds of related and similar terms using different sources such as Google autocomplete, Quora, People Also Asked, etc. 

These keywords can then be easily put back through our clustering algorithm, so you know which pages and how many pages you need to create to cover a topic comprehensively. All without leaving Keyword Insights.

### How do you use Keyword Discovery?

Start with your  **Seed keyword.**

Type your keyword and select location and language. Click search.

This helps you assess whether the topic is worth pursuing. Within this section, you can gauge the keyword's competitiveness and trending patterns. It's your go-to place for making informed decisions about your content strategy.

1. **Keyword list:** This shows you all the related keywords for your seed term. 
2. **Keyword Google trend:** This shows the Google trends data for the seed term.
3. **Live SERP preview:** This shows a real-time render of the actual SERPs for the seed term.

The next step is to view all the keywords. Click the "View All Keywords' button to see the keyword list.
