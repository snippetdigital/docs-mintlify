Get Your Brand Seen In LLMs With Social Mentions including Reddit, Quora and YouTube


When you run a clustering report, the output now highlights if your keywords/cluster trigger social links like Reddit, YouTube or Quora.

So this gives you an opportunity to get your brand mentioned in these social channels and communities.

But, why getting brand mentions in these channels is important?

According to a [study](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1620335/top-web-domains-cited-by-llms/) by Statista in collaboration with Semrush, Reddit was cited in around 40% of analyzed cases. This is likely tied to content licensing deals that make Reddit a key source for AI model training. YouTube followed with 23.5%, while sites like Quora came in at 4.6%.

The takeaway is simple. If you want your brand to show up in models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Perplexity, your brand name needs to be mentioned across these social platforms.

That is why we are rolling out our new feature

Whenever you run a clustering project, we will automatically detect if any of the major social platforms are present in the SERPs for your clusters. This gives you two opportunities. First, you can create content around those clusters. Second, you can join the conversations that are already ranking in the top ten results for your keywords and make sure your brand becomes part of those discussions. Just remember, this is not about spamming. Always check the rules, respect the community, and add real value.
