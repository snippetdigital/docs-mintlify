title: "What is Keyword Insights?"
---

Keyword Insights helps you build topical authority so you can win visibility in Google and get mentioned in AI answers.

Instead of treating SEO as one great page at a time, Keyword Insights turns messy keyword research into a clear plan: topic clusters that show what pages to create, what gaps to fill, and what to prioritize to own a topic end to end. 

From there, you can generate ranking focused content briefs based on what is already working in the SERPs, then create and optimise content with our AI Writer Agent tailored to the right page type and search intent. 

It also goes beyond your website. Keyword Insights surfaces high intent Reddit, Quora, and YouTube conversations where your brand can contribute and earn credible mentions that influence what AI models say about you.
