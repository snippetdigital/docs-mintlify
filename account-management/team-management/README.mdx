We understand the importance of Teamwork, and unlike other tools, we don't want to tie you into expensive team plans. Even our basic plan comes with 3 user seats. 

### How to invite a team member?

Go to Settings -> Organisation settings -> 

Under "Add team members" 

Add your teammates' email addresses and click "Send invite"

Your teammate will receive an email and click the Authenticate button to gain access to your organisation.

### Can a team member access my billing details?

The answer is no. Your team members can use your credits and cannot upgrade/downgrade or access billing details. Only the admin can access these features. 

### How do I remove a team member?

Click the "Delete" icon to remove a member.
