### How does it work?

We will charge you the difference between the current and new packages if you upgrade your subscription. In addition, we give credit for the difference. i.e., If you're on the $58 plan (6K credits) and upgraded to the $145 plan (15K credits), we'll charge you $87 (Price difference) and add 9K credits (credit difference), and we will move you to the new subscription so your next bill is on the $145 plan.
