### How do I cancel a subscription?

It's straightforward to cancel a subscription. Go to Settings -> Subscription and click 'Cancel subscription."

You will be asked to confirm the cancellation and fill out a short survey; your subscription will be immediately cancelled once confirmed.

After your subscription is cancelled, your monthly clustering credits will be available until the end of your billing cycle. After the end of the billing cycle, these credits will be reset. 

All of your credits including pay-as-you-go and any top-up credits will reset at the end of your billing period or on the effective cancellation date.
