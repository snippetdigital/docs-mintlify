### How does it work?

For downgrades, we will move you to a lower subscription without any additional charges, and it takes effect at the end of the current billing period. i.e., suppose you're on the $299 (45K credits) plan and downgrade to the $145 package (15K credits). In that case, You will still be able to use your 45K credits until the end of your billing cycle; at the end of the billing cycle, we will reset your remaining/unused subscription clustering credits and charge you the new lower package of $145.
