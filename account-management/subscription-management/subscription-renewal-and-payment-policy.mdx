title: "Subscription Renewal & Payment Policy"

This guide explains how Keyword Insights handles annual subscription renewals, payment attempts, failed charges, data deletion, and refund policy.

### 1. Automatic Renewal

All Keyword Insights subscriptions are set to auto-renew by default.

* Your annual plan will automatically renew on your renewal date (visible in your billing settings).
* The plan and price will match your existing subscription unless you’ve made changes.
* The charge will be made using your default payment method on file.

<Warning>

 Important: Please ensure your card is active and has sufficient funds before your renewal date to avoid service disruption.

</Warning>

### 2. Payment Attempt Schedule

If the initial payment fails, our payment processor (Stripe) will retry the charge:

* Up to 8 attempts
* Spread over a 21-day period

Each attempt will use the same card on file. You can update your payment method at any time from your account settings.

### 3. Failed Payment Notifications

If a payment attempt fails, we’ll notify you via email:

* First email: Immediately after the first failed attempt
* Second email: 7 days after the first failure
* Third email: 15 days after the first failure

These reminders are designed to give you enough time to update your payment method and ensure continuity of service.

### 4. Cancellation & Data Deletion

If we’re unable to successfully charge your card within the 21-day retry window:

* Your subscription will be automatically cancelled on the 21st day
* All of your associated data (projects, keywords, reports, etc.) will be permanently deleted

<Warning>

Please note: Once your data is deleted, we cannot recover it. This action is **final**.

</Warning>

### 5. Refund Policy

We operate with a strict **no refund** policy.

* All payments are final.
* Once the charge is successfully processed, no refunds will be issued under any circumstances.

<Warning>

No Refunds. No Exceptions.

</Warning>
