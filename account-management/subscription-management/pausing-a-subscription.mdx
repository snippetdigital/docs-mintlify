### Can I use the tool while the subscription is paused?

Once you pause the subscription you’ll still have full access to all features until the end of your current billing cycle. After that, your subscription will be paused, and all features will be unavailable until you resume. For example, if you paused your subscription on May 27th but your renewal date is June 27th, the pause will only take effect on June 27th. (You won't be charged on the June 27th) This means you’ll still have full access to your subscription and credits up until that renewal date.

### Why should I pause my subscription?

Pausing your subscription lets you keep your data, settings, and account intact without being billed. 

### How many times can i pause per year

Pause for **up to three months** and **only twice a year**.

### What happens at the end of the pause period? 

Your plan will automatically resume on the scheduled unpause date, and you’ll be charged the full subscription amount immediately upon reactivation.

### Can i resume my subscription before the auto resume date? 

Yes you can do this anytime. Go to Settings -> Subscription and click 'Resume subscription."

### What happens if i resume my subscription before the auto resume date?

When you resume your subscription manually before the auto resume, your account will be reactivated immediately, allowing you to use the application right away. However, since no payment was collected during the paused period, your credits will not be renewed until your next billing cycle. This means full access is restored instantly, but credit renewal will align with your upcoming scheduled payment.

### What happens to my subscription and PAYG credits during pause?

PAYG and Top-up credits will remain frozen until the subscription is renewed. Once the subscription is reactivated and the user is successfully charged, the associated subscription credits will be added to the account. Plus the PAYG and Top-up credits unfrozen and available immediately. 

### Can I pause my annual subscription?

Unfortunately no.
