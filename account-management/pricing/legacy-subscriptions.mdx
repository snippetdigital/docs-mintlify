### What is a Legacy Customer?

A legacy customer is anyone who purchased a Keyword Insights subscription on or before February 12th, 2025. These customers maintain access to the pricing structure, features, and terms that were available at the time of their initial subscription.

### How Do I Know If I'm a Legacy Customer?

You can easily verify your legacy status by following these steps:

1. Log into your Keyword Insights account
2. Navigate to "Settings"
3. Select "Subscriptions" from the menu
4. Look for text that identifies you as a legacy customer

If you see a notification stating you're on a legacy plan, your subscription is grandfathered under the terms that were in place when you originally subscribed.

### What Happens If I Want to Upgrade to an Annual Subscription from My Legacy Monthly Subscription?

If you're currently on a legacy subscription and wish to upgrade to an annual plan:

You'll be moved to our latest plans with updated pricing and features. Please note that **legacy plans are no longer available,** so any changes will be permanent. If you cancel, you won't be able to return to this plan. Refunds are not available for any plan changes, so we recommend reviewing the new plans carefully before making a decision.

### What Happens If I Cancel My Legacy Subscription?

If you decide to cancel your legacy subscription:

You won't be able to return to this plan at a later date. Refunds are not available for any plan changes or cancellations. We recommend reviewing your needs and our current offerings carefully before canceling your legacy subscription.

### Will You Grandfather Me Forever?

For the past 5 years, we've grandfathered all of our customers to honor our commitment to those who joined us early in our journey. However, there may be unforeseen circumstances such as massive price hikes, technical debt/limitations, etc. that could require us to revisit legacy plans.

In these rare cases, we may decide to cease your grandfathered offer. Should this occur, we promise to:

1. Provide you with plenty of advance notice
2. Offer alternative solutions that aim to maintain value comparable to your legacy plan
3. Work with you to find the best path forward that meets your needs

We value our legacy customers and will make every effort to continue supporting you on your current terms for as long as reasonably possible.
