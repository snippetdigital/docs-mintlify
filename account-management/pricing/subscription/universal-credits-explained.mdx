## We offer a robust universal credits system that allows subscribers to access any feature within the app using their credits.

### **Monthly/Annual subscription** 

With a subscription, you receive X credits each month, which can be used across any feature in the app. At the end of each billing cycle, unused credits will be reset, and a fresh set of credits will be added. If you cancel your subscription, all remaining credits will expire at the end of your billing period.

### Credit top-up (For users with a Subscription)

If you run out of credits before your quota is replenished, you can purchase additional credits as a top-up. These credits are available at discounted rates based on your subscription plan.

### **Pay as you go**

For occasional users, we offer a pay-as-you-go option with no commitment. Purchase unlimited credits anytime, valid for 30 days. These credits can be used **exclusively for keyword clustering**. If you need search intent data, it’s available for an additional 1 credit per keyword and for rank checking it costs an additional credit.  So it means you need 3 credits per keyword to cluster, classify search intent and get rank data. This is perfect for users who prefer flexibility without a monthly subscription.

**Note:** Accessing features like content briefs or writer assistant requires a monthly subscription.

### How do you calculate credits for clustering? 

The number of required credits depends on the insights you choose and the number of keywords you upload. 1 keyword = 1 credit. 

If you enable search intent for your clustering, you have to pay one additional credit and one additional credit for rank checking

**E.g.1,** If you upload 40,000 keywords, you will need 40,000 credits to cluster them. 

**E.g.2,** If you upload 40,000 keywords and select search intent alongside clustering, you will need 80,000 credits. 

**E.g.2,** If you upload 40,000 keywords and select search intent alongside clustering and enable rank checking, you will need 120,000 credits.

Pro Tip: Even if you’re an occasional user, we recommend opting for the basic monthly subscription and topping up with additional clustering credits as needed. This approach gives you access to credits at a lower rate.
