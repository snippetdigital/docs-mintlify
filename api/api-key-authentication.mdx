description: "Create and use API keys to authenticate with the Keyword Insights API"
---

API keys provide a simple, long-lived way to authenticate with the Keyword Insights public API. Unlike Bearer tokens (which expire), API keys remain valid until you delete them — making them ideal for scripts, integrations, and automated workflows.

<Info>
  API key access is available on **Professional** and **Premium** plans. If you're on a different plan, you'll be prompted to upgrade when attempting to create an API key.
</Info>

### Creating an API Key

1. Log in to your [Keyword Insights dashboard](https://app.keywordinsights.ai).
2. Navigate to **API Keys** from the left sidebar menu.
3. Click the **Create API key** button.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the key (e.g. "Python scripts", "N8N integration").
5. Click **Create**.

Once created, your API key will be displayed **once**. Copy it immediately and store it in a secure location — you will not be able to see the full key again.

Your key will look like this:

```
kwi_sk_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ1234567890abc
```

After you close the modal, the key list will show only the prefix (e.g. `kwi_sk_aBcDe...`) along with the creation date and last used date.

### Using the API Key

Pass your API key in the `X-API-Key` header with every request:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "kwi_sk_your_api_key_here"
BASE_URL = "https://api.keywordinsights.ai"

response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/user/",
    headers={"X-API-Key": API_KEY},
)

print(response.json())
```

<Warning>
  Treat your API key like a password. Do not commit it to version control or share it publicly. Use environment variables to store it securely.
</Warning>

### Storing the Key Securely

We recommend loading your API key from an environment variable:

```bash
export KWI_API_KEY="kwi_sk_your_api_key_here"
```

Then in Python:

```python
import os

API_KEY = os.environ["KWI_API_KEY"]
```

### Example: Create a Clustering Order

```python
import os
import requests

API_KEY = os.environ["KWI_API_KEY"]
BASE_URL = "https://api.keywordinsights.ai"

payload = {
    "project_name": "My clustering project",
    "keywords": [
        "keyword clustering",
        "keyword research",
        "topical authority",
    ],
    "search_volumes": [2300, 3210, 5500],
    "language": "en",
    "location": "United States",
    "device": "desktop",
    "clustering_method": "volume",
    "grouping_accuracy": 4,
    "hub_creation_method": "medium",
    "insights": ["cluster", "rank", "context"],
    "url": "https://example.com",
}

response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/keywords-insights/order/",
    headers={"X-API-Key": API_KEY},
    json=payload,
)

order = response.json()
print(order)
```

The response will contain an `order_id` that you'll use to retrieve results once the order is processed.

### Example: Chained Requests

A typical workflow involves creating an order and then retrieving the results once processing is complete. Here's a complete example that creates a clustering order, polls for completion, and downloads the results:

```python
import os
import time
import requests

API_KEY = os.environ["KWI_API_KEY"]
BASE_URL = "https://api.keywordinsights.ai"
HEADERS = {"X-API-Key": API_KEY}


def create_order(keywords, search_volumes):
    """Create a clustering order and return the order ID."""
    payload = {
        "project_name": "Chained API example",
        "keywords": keywords,
        "search_volumes": search_volumes,
        "language": "en",
        "location": "United States",
        "device": "desktop",
        "clustering_method": "volume",
        "grouping_accuracy": 4,
        "hub_creation_method": "medium",
        "insights": ["cluster", "context"],
        "url": "https://example.com",
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/api/keywords-insights/order/",
        headers=HEADERS,
        json=payload,
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()


def get_order_status(order_id):
    """Check if the order has finished processing."""
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/api/keywords-insights/order/{order_id}/",
        headers=HEADERS,
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()


def get_results_json(order_id, page_size=50, page_number=1):
    """Retrieve clustering results as JSON."""
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/api/keywords-insights/order/json/{order_id}/",
        headers=HEADERS,
        params={
            "page_size": page_size,
            "page_number": page_number,
            "sort_by": "search_volume",
            "ascending": False,
        },
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()


# --- Run the workflow ---

keywords = ["best running shoes", "running shoes review", "top sneakers for running"]
volumes = [12000, 8500, 3200]

# Step 1: Create the order
order = create_order(keywords, volumes)
order_id = order["result"]["order_id"]
print(f"Order created: {order_id}")

# Step 2: Poll until complete
while True:
    status = get_order_status(order_id)
    state = status["result"]["status"]
    print(f"Status: {state}")

    if state == "completed":
        break

    time.sleep(30)  # wait 30 seconds before checking again

# Step 3: Get the results
results = get_results_json(order_id)
print(f"Got {len(results['result']['items'])} clusters")

for cluster in results["result"]["items"]:
    print(f"  - {cluster['cluster_name']} ({cluster['cluster_size']} keywords)")
```

### Managing API Keys

You can manage your API keys from the dashboard at any time:

- **View keys** — see all active keys with their prefix, creation date, and last used date.
- **Delete keys** — revoke a key immediately. Any application using that key will lose access.

To delete a key, click the trash icon next to the key and confirm the deletion.

<Info>
  Deleting an API key is immediate and permanent. Make sure no active integrations depend on the key before deleting it.

### API Key vs. Bearer Token (Deprecated)

| | API Key (Recommended) | Bearer Token (Deprecated) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **How to obtain** | Dashboard &rarr; API Keys | Login endpoint or browser dev tools |
| **Header** | `X-API-Key: kwi_sk_...` | `Authorization: Bearer eyJ...` |
| **Expires** | Never (until deleted) | After a set period |
| **Best for** | Scripts, integrations, automation | — |

<Warning>
  **Bearer token authentication is deprecated.** If you are currently using Bearer tokens, we strongly recommend migrating to API keys. Bearer tokens will continue to work for now, but may be removed in a future update.
</Warning>

### Migrating from Bearer Tokens

If you have existing code using Bearer tokens, switching to API keys is a one-line change — replace the `Authorization` header with `X-API-Key`:

```python
# Before (deprecated)
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}"}

# After (recommended)
headers = {"X-API-Key": API_KEY}
```

No other changes are needed — all API endpoints accept both authentication methods.
