<summary>How do special characters in my language affect the output?</summary>

Special characters are common in many languages. Such as Norwegian, Thai, Swedish, German etc.

If you're using Microsoft Excel or Mac Numbers, Please make sure to export your files with UTF-8 encoding. Else your special characters will not be exported correctly, and Keyword insights will show you an error.

When possible, we highly recommend you upload an **excel XLXS** file when dealing with special characters instead CSVs. The CSV encoding can convert special characters into random unreadable text, and it will cause our clustering and hub/spoke algorithm to produce incorrect output results.

<summary>What's the Topic cluster?</summary>

What's the Hub/spoke model, and how is it different from clusters?

Once you have your keyword clusters, it may be helpful to know how closely related those clusters are to other clusters.

By grouping similar clusters together, we create Hubs and Spokes. Using these, you'll be able to produce what we call "hub articles" which link to "spoke articles".

In essence, our "hub and spoke" tab will make your content planning easier, allowing you to quickly identify and comprehensively cover a given content topic.

**Bonus tip**: Pull through the your keyword rankings and you'll be able to see internal linking opportunities, if you have relevant existing content.

In this example, "Hawaii vacation" will form the "Hub" content piece. This could be a category page or a long-form article.

Here we are show all the "clusters" in the Spoke column that are contextually related to the hub.

So, you can produce content around "Where to stay in Hawaii" or "Planning a honeymoon to Hawaii" and internally link to our main "Hawaii vacation" hub .

<summary>What countries does your keyword clustering feature support?</summary>

Keyword clustering is not language-specific but rather geo/country-specific. We support all the countries in the world.

Let's take a look at a few examples.

I have an SEO client in France, and I'm targeting users in France. When I prepare my keyword list, I will select all the keywords and search volume data for those keywords. I will choose _**France**_ under the country dropdown when I run my order through Keyword Insights.

Keyword Insights will then scrape _**google.fr**_ and build the clusters based on how keywords are ranking in google.fr.

You can choose to upload French keywords, English keywords, or any other language. Regardless of language, Keyword Insights will scrape google.fr for those keywords.

As you can see, the language has no influence whatsoever on our clustering process.

<summary>How is the opportunity score calculated?</summary>

Most tools see how much volume a keyword gets to create an opportunity score, but they don't take into account two important things:

1. A realistic number of visitors based on volume can be determined by looking at the [CTR  study by AWR](https://www.advancedwebranking.com/ctrstudy/). Based on this study, if you rank in position 1, you can expect to get 38% of the clicks, position 2 gets 13%, position 3 gets 8% etc.
2. It doesn't consider where you currently rank (and, therefore, the opportunity).

So we calculate the opportunity score by doing the following.

If someone ranks in position 1 for a keyword, the opportunity score will be "0", as they already rank for it. However, if they rank in position 2, it will be the difference between the percentage scores of position 1 and position 2. 

So we have 1 column, "maximum opportunity", which is position 1 (or 38%) multiplied by the search volume. Then another column called "current estimated traffic", which is whatever their current position is, multiplied by the volume. So if we were in position two, it would be 13% multiplied by the volume. The opportunity is then the difference between the two.

For example, "cats" has a search volume of 100. We rank in position 3.

Maximum opportunity = 38 (38% x 100) Current Estimated traffic = 8 (8% x 100) Opportunity = 30 (30 - 8).
