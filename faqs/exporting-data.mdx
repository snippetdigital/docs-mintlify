As clustering reports expanded from 10 to over 40 data columns, the previous export process occasionally hit Google Sheets row limits and struggled to handle larger reports, especially those containing pivot tables. 

Many users also requested the ability to download raw CSV files for easier use in custom workflows, automations, and scripts.

The new export feature addresses all of these issues. 

You can now export large datasets smoothly to either Google Sheets or CSV without limitations. The process is significantly faster, more stable, and designed to scale with your data needs.

Now you will see 2 simple export options.

**1. Export Full Project** – Export all project data, including pivot tables, with or without applied filters. You can choose to download it as a Google Sheet or Excel file.

**2. Export Raw Data (Non-Pivoted)** – Export all project data without pivot tables, with or without applied filters. Selecting this option enables the CSV export button, allowing you to download the complete dataset in raw CSV format directly from our servers.
