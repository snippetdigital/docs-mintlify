### What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are the foundation of Keyword Insights. They allow you to link a domain (also called a workspace or property) to your account so that everything you do in the platform is tied to a specific domain.

By setting up workspaces, you ensure your data, reports, and projects are organized correctly. Workspaces also unlock future features such as reporting, keyword management, performance tracking, and more personalized experiences based on your business context.

### How to Set Up a Workspace 

**Step 1 - Add your brand name, domain, target country and language**

When you sign up, new users are prompted to add a bunch of details during onboarding.

In the first step, you will be asked to provide a few important details. Make sure the information is accurate, as these settings cannot be changed once a workspace is created.

**Brand name:** This is your brand name. e.g: Nike or Universal containers

<Check>

Please enter your brand name exactly as it is used in your business. This ensures our future features, such as brand mention detection, can accurately recognize and track your brand.

</Check>

**Workspace domain:** This is your brands domain name. Use one workspace per domain to keep all related projects and reports in one place.

**Location:** Your target country.

**Language:** Your target language. 

**Step 2 - Select Your Workspace**

Once you enter the details in step one, we will automatically gather and pre-fill the required data for step two.

This information is important because it is used to personalize your output and enable future features.

You will be able to review and edit this information as needed. Please double-check everything before moving on to the final step.

Users can select the "Legacy Platform" workspace and continue to use the tool as it is without the new workspaces feature. 

**Step 3 - Connect Google Search Console**

In the final step, you have the option to connect your Google Search Console account. This allows us to link your GSC data with your clusters and other features in the future. While this step is optional, we strongly recommend connecting your account for the best experience. If you prefer, you can skip it now and connect later from the Integrations page.

Important: We [never sell or share](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/privacy-policy/) your Google Search Console data with third parties. Your data is not exposed to any LLM models. If you delete your data, all imported GSC data is permanently deleted as well.

<Warning>

**Important:** To connect a Google Search Console account to your Workspace, you’ll need full domain-level access verified through DNS records. If you don’t have this, ask your webmaster for access. You can also skip this step for now and complete the connection later.

</Warning>

Once added, you’ll see a global domain selector in the top navigation bar.

All features you use in Keyword Insights will now pre-populate with the selected domain, language, and location

### What if I am an existing customer and do not want to use Workspaces?

We have enabled a Legacy Mode for existing customers. You can select this option from the dropdown menu to continue working as usual.

<Warning>

Please note that Legacy Mode **will not be supported indefinitely**. Once the majority of customers have transitioned to Workspaces, Legacy Mode will be discontinued. 

</Warning>

We highly recommend gradually moving your projects into Workspaces to benefit from improved organization and upcoming features such as Brand Echo.

### How many Workspaces can I get?

Workspaces are assigned according to your subscription plan, with each workspace tied to a unique domain.

| Basic | Professional | Premium |
| ----- | ------------ | ------- |
| 5     | 10           | 25      |

### As a Legacy user, are there limits on how many Workspaces I can use?

Yes. To support long-time customers who may have built up many projects, Legacy users are allocated 10 Workspaces. This gives you enough capacity to migrate existing projects at your own pace.

### How do we organize Projects and Folders in Legacy Mode and Workspaces?

Projects and folders are always linked to specific domains within Workspaces. This flexibility ensures your reporting and content planning remain well organized.

### How do I manage Team Visibility?

All team members automatically see all Workspaces within the organization. For more control, you can adjust access at the folder or project level.

### How do Integrations work in Workspaces?

Google Search Console and WordPress integrations are validated and linked directly to Workspaces. Each Google Search Console account can only be added once to prevent duplication.

### How do I delete a Workspace?

To delete a Workspace, go to Manage Workspaces and select Delete. You will be asked to confirm before proceeding. Once confirmed, the Workspace and all related folders and projects will be permanently deleted. This action cannot be reversed.

<Warning>

If you delete a workspace, **all associated folders and projects will be permanently removed**. You will be asked to confirm before proceeding. Please note that this action cannot be reversed, and Snippet Digital is not responsible for any data loss caused by misuse of this feature.

#### Best Practices for using workspaces

* Use one workspace per domain to keep all related projects and reports in one place.
* Check your subscription plan before adding domains, as limits vary by plan.
* Share strategically by using folder or project-level permissions when needed.
* Review workspaces regularly and clean up unused ones for better efficiency.
