title: "What is Keyword Insights?"
---


Keyword Insights is the first dedicated tool designed to help brands become topical authorities within their niche. Within the same platform, you can generate thousands of keyword ideas, group them into strategic topic clusters, and seamlessly push them into our AI Writing Assistant to create or optimize content.


To put it succinctly, our platform enables you to begin with a primary keyword and access a wealth of associated keyword ideas. These ideas can then be organized into clusters based on the overlap of URLs within Google search result pages (SERPs). 

The result is the effortless creation of highly detailed content briefs, high quality and unique content, all from within our user-friendly interface, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools or platforms.
