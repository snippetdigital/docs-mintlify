title: "Competitor Visibility"
---

Within your keyword cluster project, you can head to the competitor visibility tab to get a top-eye view of how your competitors are doing for that same group of keywords you've uploaded. 

You have to do your keyword research, upload the keywords to the keyword clustering tab, and add your domain for tracking; we'll show you which competitors are doing better for your "target clusters" than you.

### How to use the feature.

Go to your clustering report and click "Competitor visibility."
