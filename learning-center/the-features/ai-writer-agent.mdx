### **How does our AI Writer Agent works?**

The agent starts with your keyword, runs keyword research and checks competitor pages to spot missing content. It also looks at other sources for extra ideas. Once done, it builds an outline and writes the article in clear, natural language. You can set the tone, length, and how different you want it to be. The entire process is fully automated.

### **What’s the difference between the Writer assistant and the AI Writer Agent?**

Our regular Writer assistant gives you full control over what you create. You manage the research, writing, and optimization yourself. In contrast, the Agent handles everything automatically using all available data and tools. It’s faster and hands-off, but you give up some control in the process.

### How do you go from Clustering to producing content?

We have significantly simplified the process so that you can go from a cluster output to content in a few clicks. You get to skip all the work and still maintain a good level of quality.

### Is AI content bad for SEO?

This is what Google say

_"Our focus on the quality of content, rather than how content is produced, is a useful guide that has helped us deliver reliable, high quality results to users for years."_

We built this agent with this in mind and our 'Add your own insights' feature will help make your content useful and valuable. Plus we pull data from multiple sources via our deep research agent.

### What if multiple users enter the same keyword? Won’t the AI generate identical content for all of them?

Even if you use the same keyword multiple times, the output won’t be exactly the same. it will differ slightly with each run. That said, to make your content truly stand out and provide value, we recommend adding your own insights and expertise whenever you can.
