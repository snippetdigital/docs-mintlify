title: "Topical Clusters"
---

Once you have your keyword clusters, it may be helpful to know how closely related those clusters are to other clusters. We apply NLP to find the semantic relationship between the clusters.


In addition to clustering your keywords, we apply Natural Language Processing to "cluster your clusters" so to speak.

This allows you to view how similar specific clusters are to one another so that you can easily plan and create content.

### What is the purpose of the topical cluster report?

Each specific area can be further dissected. For instance, under "how to do keyword research for Amazon", you might create content that provides a general overview, another piece reviewing the best research tools, and a third focusing on tracking down competitor keywords on Amazon.

The topical cluster report is here to simplify this intricate process. It identifies and groups related topics (clusters) together, aiding you in organizing your content and ensuring that you cover each topic thoroughly and logically, making your journey to becoming a topical authority smoother and more strategic.

Take a look at the screenshot below. You will quickly see about 15 "clusters" all grouped together within 1 big cluster.

You can't quite make it out here, but examples of some of the clusters include:

* How to do keyword research for Amazon
* Best Amazon Keyword research tools
* How to do affiliate keyword research for Amazon

Amongst some others. As you'll notice, these are all clusters related to "keyword research" and "Amazon", but are all slightly different in their intent. Each will need its own separate article. 

To summarise, the "topical cluster" report groups similar clusters together. This should make it really easy for you to plan and become a "topical authority" on a given subject by grouping all the related topics you need to cover together. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** The topical clusters report uses NLP to group similar clusters together. So depending on your niche, and the settings you apply, they may not always be useful. Your results will vary. As with any tool, this feature is designed to speed up your processes but it will not be perfect. A large part of your success also depends on the types of keywords you upload. Please read more about the advanced settings which you should use [here](https://docs.keywordinsights.ai/learning-center/the-features/keyword-clustering/the-advanced-settings/topical-cluster-creation-method).

<Info>

**How to get the report:** The topical clusters report happens automatically as part of every clustering project, so it isn't a setting you need to select. However, as mentioned above, you can adjust the settings as you're creating the project.

You can either view them in a table or the bubble format as above. 

Alternatively, you can export a Google Drive or Excel report as per the screenshot below 👇

Where the output will resemble a pivot table similar to the "table" within the UI.
