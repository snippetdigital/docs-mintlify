This helps you assess whether the topic is worth pursuing. Within this section, you can gauge the keyword's competitiveness and trending patterns. It's your go-to place for making informed decisions about your content strategy.

### Step#3

### What do I do after using Keyword Discovery?

The next step is to get search volume for your keywords. There are 2 ways to do this. 

1. Use keyword insights built-in search volume module. We will get search volume, CPC, competition and trend data from Google keyword planner. It will cost you one credit per keyword to use this module. 
2. You can export your keywords to any of your favourite SEO tools (e.g., Ahrefs) and get your search volume. Once you have the data, go directly to our[ keyword clustering module](keyword-clustering/#step-2) and upload your file. 

How do you use Keyword insights to get search volume data?

Select the keywords for which you want to calculate search volume and click the search volume button in the floating bar.
