title: "Keyword Grouping Accuracy"

### What is keyword grouping accuracy?

The minimum number of URLs in the SERPs required to group keywords. The selected grouping accuracy will influence the number of keywords in a single group. The higher the accuracy, the fewer keywords will be put into a single group.

By default, we use the value 3. It means if we see 3 common URLs for keywords, these keywords will be put into a single cluster.

e.g. Let's take these two keywords as examples.

**Keyword 1**: weight loss with shots

**Keyword 2:** weight loss with injections

For the keyword '**weight loss with shots**, the SERPs in the United States return the following top 10 results:

```text
www.mayoclinic.org
www.cuimc.columbia.edu
www.cuimc.columbia.edu
www.medicalnewstoday.com
www.cuimc.columbia.edu
www.stylecraze.com
www.fda.gov
www.simply-slim.com
www.goodrx.com
www.wegovy.com
```

For the keyword '**weight loss with injections**' the SERPs in the United States return the following top 10 results:

```text
www.fda.gov
www.goodrx.com
www.goodrx.com
www.saxenda.com
www.cuimc.columbia.edu
www.wegovy.com
www.goodrx.com
www.medicalnewstoday.com
www.scientificamerican.com
www.hopkinsmedicine.org
```

We can see that there are four common URLs

```
www.cuimc.columbia.edu
www.goodrx.com
www.medicalnewstoday.com
www.fda.gov
```

So, we will cluster/group these into a single cluster.
