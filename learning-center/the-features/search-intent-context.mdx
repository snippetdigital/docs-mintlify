title: "Search Intent/Context"
---

Some keywords are explicit in their intent; usually, these are keywords with modifiers appended or prepended to them. Example include:

"Buy", "where", "how", "when", "coupons" etc.

But what does someone want to view when they search for something without any modifiers? What sort of content should we optimise for if the keyword is just "dogs"?

We use AI to quickly identify the search intent behind keywords at scale. Simply upload your list and we'll tell you, out of the top 10 results on Google, how many of the results are informational vs how many are transactional vs how many commercial vs how many are some other type of content.

### **Why do you call it "context" and not "intent"?**

Our competitors often talk about intent, whereas we call our insight "context". We do this because our metric works slightly differently.

When we talk about context, we mean “what is the contextual setting around this keyword?”. Let's use the example of “CBD Oil” as a keyword. On first impressions, we'd probably guess that intent behind such a keyword is transactional/commercial; surely if you search "CBD Oil" you want to buy it right? Other tools often classify the intent of that keyword as such.

Enter “Keyword Context”. If you actually witnessed the SERPs for that keyword, you’ll notice a lot of the results tend to favour more “long-form” type and not “product pages”.

This is where our metric, keyword context comes in. For the keyword “CBD Oil”, Keyword Insights would show you that the majority of results on the search engine result page are informational.

Using the above data, we can determine the most dominant intent for a given cluster. This helps us understand what type of content to create. (Whether it's an article, commercial page or a product page)

Once clustering is completed, you can easily filter your clusters.

We also offer an "Identify Intent" feature, which analyzes the SERPs for the main term of your cluster to determine the search intent for the entire cluster.

The intent behind the above keyword is “transactional”, but the context of it, currently, is “informational”, so you should create content that is informational in nature. 

### **What are the type of intent available?**

We currently offer 4 types of intent classifications. 

1. **Informational** - The user is looking for information or answers to a question. They aren’t necessarily looking to make a purchase but are seeking knowledge or insights. For example, a search like “how to improve SEO rankings” indicates informational intent.
2. **Commercial** - The user is interested in exploring products or services but hasn’t made a final decision yet. They may be comparing options or researching before making a purchase. For example, “best SEO tools” is a commercial intent query.
3. **Transactional** -The user is ready to take action, usually to make a purchase or complete a specific task. They’ve done their research and are now looking for a way to execute, such as “buy SEO software” or “buy cbd oil.” We usually classify product and product category pages. 
4. **Other** - These are pages that don't fall into any of the above. Usually a home page, terms and conditions etc. 

### How to use the Context feature? 

The context (intent) toggle is enabled by default when running a clustering project.
