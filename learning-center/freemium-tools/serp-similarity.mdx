SERP Similarity Checker will quickly show you the overlap between two keywords in the SERPs and tell you whether you should create a new page or can target multiple keywords with a single page.

This is a quick way to check if two keywords without having to use our keyword clustering module.

This insight will allow you to assemble content briefs faster and more efficiently.

### What is the SERP Similarity checker?

When working in SEO, you often encounter a situation where you quickly want to know whether you can rank two similar keywords on a single page or need to create a separate article.

The way to answer this question is to manually check the SERPs (Search engine results pages) to see how many common URLs rank for each keyword.

If we see a large number of similar pages ranking for both keywords, we can assume that both keywords can be targeted on a single page, and if we see a few common URLs, then we can assume these keywords need separate pages.

Here is an example.

In this example, there are 2 common URLs for the keywords "**crm too**l" and "**crm software**"

This tells you that these keywords are likely better off targeted using two separate pages.
