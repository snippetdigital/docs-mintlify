### Step 1: Find keyword ideas

Generate keyword ideas with keyword discovery. Use our tool to generate thousands of keywords around a specific topic. Keywords are the starting point for any successful content creation strategy.

### Step 2: Cluster keywords

Make sense of the keywords by grouping them together into topical clusters. Our machine learning model helps you identify search intent, making it easier to create content that users want.

### Step 3: Create content briefs

Move your content ideas from clusters to our briefs generator. Utilize sources such as real-time SERPs, Reddit, Quora, and more, to create a comprehensive and unique brief that covers all angles of the topic.

### Step 4: Write and optimize content

Write content with our AI writing assistant. Use previous briefs and optimize with topics, clusters, links, and more. Edit and enhance the content with our built-in AI detection tool to ensure uniqueness.
