title: "Keyword Insights Tool Workflow"
---

Keyword Insights turns keyword research into a complete content system. Instead of bouncing between tools, you can go from discovery to clustering, briefing, and production in one place, with clear priorities based on what Google already rewards and what audiences are actually asking. 

You can follow the workflow end to end, or jump into any stage depending on what you need today. 

## **The workflow explained**

### **Step 1: Discover keyword ideas**

Begin with a seed topic and generate relevant keyword ideas related to it. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how people search, rather than just a few obvious terms. Moreover, the keywords are personalized to your workspace, ensuring that you only see those relevant to your workspace or business.

### **Step 2: Cluster keywords into topics**

Group keywords into topical clusters so you know which terms belong on the same page and which need their own content. This is how you build coverage without cannibalising yourself and how you map content in a way that supports topical authority. 

### **Step 3: Create content briefs**

Turn clusters into SERP led briefs. Keyword Insights pulls from real time search results and other sources to help you create a brief that covers the angles that matter, aligns with intent, and makes writing faster and more consistent. 

### **Step 4: Write with the AI Writer Agent**

When you desire a draft that is meticulously crafted from research, rather than relying on generic templates, the AI Writer Agent is an ideal choice. It automates in-depth research, identifies content gaps, and generates a publish-ready article based on your keyword and competitor analysis. Additionally, it writes in the style of your authors, who are trained on their writing style, thereby bypassing AI detectors. 

### **Step 5: Get social mentions and rank in LLMs**

We showcase all the social opportunities available to your clusters, such as Reddit, YouTube, Quora, and so on. These platforms provide a natural environment for initiating conversations and promoting your brand. Moreover, these platforms are frequently cited by LLM models and featured in AI-generated responses, ensuring a seamless and non-spammy process.
