Integrating Google Search Console with Keyword Insights provides a powerful way to improve your keyword analysis and optimize content strategy. By quickly downloading all your search keywords into the platform, you gain access to the full dataset that reveals valuable insights about search performance. Once integrated, you can cluster keywords to identify content gaps, areas where your content isn’t covering high-potential topics and spot content cannibalization, where multiple pages compete for the same keywords, potentially undermining search rankings.
