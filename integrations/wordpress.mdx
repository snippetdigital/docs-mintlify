#### Publish your content directly with a click of a button. No copy-pasting, no plugins, just seamless automation.

Creating high-quality content is only half the battle. Once it’s ready, the next hurdle is formatting, uploading, attaching images, adding authors, and hitting publish. Our WordPress integration eliminates that bottleneck. With a simple setup using your existing WordPress login (no extra plugins required), our Writer Assistant and Agent can automatically draft or publish your articles for you. Content, images, links, and all.

### How to use the Wordpress integration?

The Wordpress integration is available from our AI Writer Assistant and AI Writer Agent. 

Click the "Publish" button from the top right hand corner.
