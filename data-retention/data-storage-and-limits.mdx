### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?

If you cancel your subscription, we will delete your data at the end-of-billing date. 

 All of your data is **permanently deleted**, and we will never be able to recover the data for you. 

Please make sure to export and back up your data before you cancel. 

<Info>

Tip: To avoid losing your data, consider pausing your subscription instead of canceling it. You can pause for up to 3 months, twice per year, during which we’ll securely store your data, settings, and other account details. You can unpause at any time to resume access.
